There is a quick-start Ant target that will start a server directly from checkout. It uses the default configuration (which has no authentication) so you won't want to use this in practice, but it is good to try out the server. To run the target you will need [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) installed.

  * [Check out the project from SVN](http://code.google.com/p/j2ssh-fork/source/checkout)
  * In the directory containing build.xml run `ant quickstart`
